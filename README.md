# Landing Project

In this project there's single web page which contain some sections, navbar and footer

I tryed in this project to :

- **Make dynamic navbar**
- **Reference each navbar link to its specific section**
- **Active the appeared section**

## Dynamic Navbar

In this Section I tryed to make a dynamic navbar which get all information from the DOM,
and create new list of items which refer to its specific section on the body
and use its classes (hover , ... etc) so it could be looks good at the end 

## Link Reference

In this Section when user click on any link on navbar it takes him smoothly to the specific part of the body 

## Active Section

the last thing when user scroll down / up on the page the section which appear to the viewport will get a class *"your-active-class"*
